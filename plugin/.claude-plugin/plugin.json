  "description": "Complete multi-agent AI system with Semantic Engine and Intelligence Package. Pure-Python TF-IDF semantic matching replaces keyword heuristics for skill selection. Bayesian inference (Beta distribution) powers memory learning, skill success ranking, and composite risk scoring. Temporal decay (exponential half-life) ensures recent data dominates. Mann-Kendall trend detection finds monotonic patterns in error/duration series. 5 intelligence features: introspective debugging, shadow learning (git diff), git conflict resolution, requirements pipeline, predictive intelligence (Bayesian composite risk with confidence intervals). Plus: V3.2 auto-select model, thinking mode, quantum dual sessions, multi-step plans, semantic memory with relevance search, 51 skills with TF-IDF matching, and 15 MCP tools.",
