  "description": "Complete multi-agent AI system with Intelligence Package. 5 revolutionary features: introspective debugging (root cause analysis, not blind retry), shadow learning (learns from your git corrections), git conflict resolution (AI-powered merge), requirements pipeline (document to executable plan), predictive intelligence (tech debt detection, health reports). Plus: V3.2 auto-select model, thinking mode, quantum parallel dual sessions, multi-step plans, surgical + global memory, 51 auto-injected skills, and 15 MCP tools. Claude Code orchestrates DeepSeek as a 128K-token self-learning code engine with free web mode.",
